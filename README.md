# CSMA/CD Simulation

This project simulates Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) in a client-server network.

## Overview

CSMA/CD manages access to a shared network medium by multiple devices. This simulation consists of a server and client components.

## Uses

1. **Server**: Run `server.py` to start listening on port 5555.
2. **Client**: Run `client.py`, connect to `127.0.0.1:8888`, and enter position data.
